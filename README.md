## TODO:
 - Scrape McDonald's caffeine data from https://www.caffeineinformer.com/mccafe-coffee-caffeine-content
 - Format the scraped caffeine data to be able to merge with nutritional data
 - Format McDonald's nutritional data to have same column names for merging
 - Merge price data with nutritional data for all 3
 - Merge all 3 data sets to be in one dataframe
 - Do some analysis with the beautiful data we've collected (caffeine per cost, sugaryness, etc)
 - Make an Rshiny app to tell people what drink to order based on their preferences (how to win)
